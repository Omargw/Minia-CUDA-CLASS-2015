Course Objective
In this class, you will learn to program NVIDIAâ€™s graphics processing units (GPUs) using CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture). According to General-Purpose computation on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU) paradigm, video cards with massive parallelism capabilities, certainly available to essentially anyone nowadays, can be used to enhance the speed of countless computationally intensive algorithms. We study how CUDA and the GPU capabilities can be subjugated to deploy fast and effective parallel implementations for many computational parallel patterns.
